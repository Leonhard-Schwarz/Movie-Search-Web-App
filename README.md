This project is a movie search application built using React. Users can search for movies by entering a query, and the app will display the search results from the OMDB API. The app includes infinite scrolling functionality to load more search results as the user scrolls. Additionally, the app offers a light and dark mode based on user preferences.

## Features

- Search for movies by entering a search term.
- Infinite scrolling for loading additional movie search results.

- Light and dark mode based on user preferences.

## Acknowledgment

This project is inspired by a tutorial from JS Mastery. The original code and tutorial can be found at [JS Mastery - React JS for Beginners Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9eMGE7QtTk&list=PLJcy0uabn41qkORUEq8DQsp-MUrwjpi6b&index=14). I added the Infinite scrolling and pressing "Enter" to search functionality. I also changed the CSS to include the light and dark mode based on user preferences.
